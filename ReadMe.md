# Ci Programming Language & `Cito` Tool

**Ci** is automatically translated language, aimed at crafting **portable programming libraries**, with syntax akin to C#.

`cito` tool automatically translates the Ci programming language to C, Java, C#, JavaScript, ActionScript, Perl and D.

The translated code is lightweight (no virtual machine, emulation or large runtime), human-readable and fits well the target language (including naming conventions and documentation comments).

Current version of Ci doesn't support standalone programs or even console output,
so your **"Hello world"** could be the following library:

```cs
public class HelloCi {
    public static string GetMessage() {
        return "Hello, world!";
    }
}
```

See [hello.ci](docs/hello.ci) for a slightly bigger example.

# How to install

`cito` is written in C#.

On Windows you need .NET Framework 3.5.
[Download cito binaries](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cito/files/cito/0.4.0/cito-0.4.0-bin.zip/download)
and extract `cito.exe` to a directory in your `PATH` environment variable.

On other platforms install [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com). Mono runs .NET executables:

```
mono cito.exe
```

For your convenience, create Mono wrapper scripts such as:

```
#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/bin/mono /usr/local/lib/cito/cito.exe "$@"
```

so that you can type `cito` instead of `mono cito.exe`.

# How to use

Call `cito` from command prompt passing source files (with the extension `.ci`) and one of the destination files
(its filename extension determines the target language), for example:

```
cito -o hello.c hello.ci
cito -o HelloCi.java hello.ci
```

`cito` only generates source code. It is your responsibility to compile it.
